One of my questions was what are the different reason people get affected by something like insomnia, it could be something like their age, their job, 
their gender, or how much they do during the day. The biggest reason their quality of sleep was affected wass because they were stressed about something. 
Higher their stress level was, the lower their sleep quality was. If you look at the data table it clearly shows that people with less stress sleep better. in the 
At the beginning of the data table there are two males, one has a stress level of eight and the other has a stress level of seven. the male with the higher stress level 
rated their quality of sleep a four. The male with a lower stress level rated their sleep quality a six. That is scientific proof that less stress makes you sleep better. 
So school tell you to get at least eight hours or sleep a night do not really care about students sleep because the reason students do not sleep might be because of stress and 
school might be the only reason the student is stressed out at all.
