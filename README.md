For the Final Project -- Data Wrangling, add the following to this code repository:

* An R script file containing the code you used to create your unified dataset 
* Your unified and cleaned CSV dataset file
* Data Nutrition Label (pdf) 


**Link: Link to your Shiny App here**

Please create the necessary files for your multi-page Shiny app in this GitHub repository. Consult the Canvas assignment for more details. Be sure to publish your app on Shinyapps.io.

When you are finished, please add the text from your introductory and concluding pages below. You might want to use this GitHub repository as part of your digital portfolio, so you want this README.md to offer a brief description of the project and key takeaways.

Feel free to delete these instructions for your final README.md file and to make your GitHub repository public if you would like others to be able to see it. 

# Introduction

An introductory page that provides an overview of the project. What major questions are you seeking to answer? What data are you using to answer those questions? Please provide a URL link to the original source(s) of the data. Where did the data come from, and what are possible ethical questions or limitations to consider with this dataset? You should also include some additional "flare" on this landing page, such as an image.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

A conclusion page of summary takeaways that hones in on at least 3 major takeaways from the project, which should be related to a specific aspect of your analysis. This page should include at least 250 words of text, but feel free to incorporate tables, graphics, or other elements necessary to convey your conclusions.
